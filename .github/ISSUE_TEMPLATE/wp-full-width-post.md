name: WP-Full Width Post
These are my first attempt using the Current WP-Template installed on site:

I installed the bootstrap to site and then used the three column layout as we learned form Colt's lesson,

but the CSS would not working the image and the table would not match to the "sidebar version of the post.

<div id="primary" class="widget-area" role="complementary">
<ul class="xoxo">
